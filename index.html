<p class="app-large" style="margin-top: 30px;">Measurement Kit is a network measurement engine.
It implements open network measurement methodologies
(performance, censorship, etc.) on Unix-like operating systems such
as Android, iOS, Linux, and macOS, as well as on Windows.  It is meant to be embedded by
third party applications with specific network measurement needs
and/or to be used by researchers to implement novel network measurement
tools. It started as an engine implementing
<a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">OONI</a> nettests and since then
has grown to include also other nettests.

<p class="app-large">Measurement Kit
is currently used to implement <a
href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">OONI apps</a> for all platforms. It
is also integrated by other parties, mainly to run our implementation
of the <a
href="https://github.com/ndt-project/ndt">NDT</a> network performance
test on mobile platforms.</p>

<p class="app-large">All our code
is inside the <a href="https://github.com/measurement-kit">measurement-kit</a>
GitHub organization. The main repository, also called
<a href="https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit">
measurement-kit</a> is the entry point to learn more
about Measurement Kit.</p>

<p class="app-large">Measurement Kit is a project by <a
href="https://github.com/bassosimone">@bassosimone</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/hellais">@hellais</a>, et al, carried out
in 2013&mdash;2017 in the context of <a href="https://nexa.polito.it/">Nexa
Center</a>'s <a href="https://nexa.polito.it/morfeo">MORFEO</a> and
<a href="https://nexa.polito.it/neubot">Neubot</a> projects, and
financed by the European Commission (for MORFEO) and by <a
href="https://measurementlab.net/">Measurement Lab</a> and <a
href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> through two distinct
research grants. In 2018 Measurement Kit has been financed
through a
<a href="https://www.opentech.fund/funds/icfp/">ICFP OTF Fellowship</a>
at <a href="https://measurementlab.net/">Measurement Lab</a>.
Since 2019 Measurement Kit is a
<a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">OONI</a> project.</p>
